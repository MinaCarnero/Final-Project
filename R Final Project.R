# Project + Github repository ---------------------------------------------

# Name of the Github repository: Final Project
# Name of the Project: Final-Project
# Name of the script: R Final Project

# Version Control ---------------------------------------------------------

# Some evidence of version control:
# I created an object (a) which was a sequence from 1 to 100, and then I deleted it. I made other 
# modifications in the text as well. All these changes are going to be highlighted in red if you 
# delete something and in green if you add something (it should be the latest version of your work).
# This is visible when you hit commit after saving the script. Then, after making a comment and 
# hitting commit, you hit push and you will be able to see the new version of your script in 
# your file saved in your Github repository/Final Project/R Final Project

a <- c(1:100)
rm(a)
